The goal of `TidyTuesdayAltText` is to provide insight into the
alternative (alt) text accompanying the data visualizations shared on
Twitter as part of the TidyTuesday social project[1].

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of TidyTuesdayAltText from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
``` r
install.packages("TidyTuesdayAltText")
```
-->

You can install the development version of `TidyTuesdayAltText` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("spcanelon/TidyTuesdayAltText")
```

### Note about installing from a private repo

While this repo is private, you will first have to make sure to provide
authentication to GitHub using a [Personal Access Token
(PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
as a credential. You can follow the steps in the credential caching
chapter of Happy Git with R (summarized below): [Chapter 10 Cache
credentials for HTTPS \| Happy Git and GitHub for the
useR](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html)

1.  Create a personal access token using a [`usethis` package helper
    function](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/create_github_token.html)
    which pre-selects recommended scopes/permissions:
    `usethis::create_github_token()`

2.  Then store your token somewhere safe and treat it like you would a
    password.

3.  Call an R function to store your credentials using the
    [`credentials` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/credentials/)
    which will prompt you to enter your token:
    `credentials::set_github_pat()`<br> This populates the `GITHUB_PAT`
    environment variable that `install_github()` defaults to as the
    authentication token (i.e. **auth\_token**) argument.

4.  Finally, proceed to install the package as usual:
    `devtools::install_github("spcanelon/TidyTuesdayAltText")`

## About the data

The package contains 5 datasets:

``` r
library(TidyTuesdayAltText)
?ttTweets2018
?ttTweets2019
?ttTweets2020
?ttTweets2021
?AltTextSubset
```

Original data were collected and made available by Tom Mock
([@thomas\_mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock)) using
[{rtweet}](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet).

Tweets were processed and scraped for alternative text by Silvia Canelón
([@spcanelon](https://twitter.com/spcanelon))

1.  Data were filtered to remove tweets without attached media
    (e.g. images)
2.  Data were supplemented with reply tweets collected using {rtweet}.
    This was done to identify whether the original tweet or a reply
    tweet contained an external link (e.g. data source, repository with
    source code)
3.  Alternative (alt) text was scraped from tweet images using
    [{RSelenium}](https://docs.ropensci.org/RSelenium/). The first image
    attached to each tweet was considered the primary image and only the
    primary image from each tweet was scraped for alternative text. The
    following attributes were used to build the scraper:

-   CSS selector: `.css-1dbjc4n.r-1p0dtai.r-1mlwlqe.r-1d2f490.r-11wrixw`
-   Element attribute: `aria-label`

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="man/figures/webInspection.png" alt="Web inspection tool being used to identify the CSS selector corresponding to the primary image of one of Silvia's tweets with alt text" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">

utilized for alt-text web scraping
</p>

</div>

This data package does not include data that could directly identify the
tweet author in order to respect any author’s decision to delete a tweet
or make their account private after the data was originally
collected.[2]

To obtain the tweet text, author screen name, and many other tweet
attributes, you can “rehydrate” the `TweetId`s (or “status” ids[3])
using the {rtweet} package.[4]

### AltTextSubset

A dataset containing the alternative text for media shared between 2018
and 2021 as part of the TidyTuesday social project, and other attributes

only tweets with alternative text that isn’t “Image,” the default
alternative text added by the Twitter app in the absence of customized
alternative text. More information can be found using `?AltTextSubset`.

package in development and performing the analyses that went into our

<!--
## Example
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```r
library(TidyTuesdayAltText)
## basic example code
```
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
